Nauts World is an innovative NFT-based game built on the Internet Computer blockchain. It offers a unique gaming experience where players can mint, trade, and use variants of 12 different Mobile Suits called Nauts. These Nauts will be utilised in trials, which can be wagered like pink slips, providing an exciting competitive aspect to the game. The game lobby, set in a space station, serves as the central hub for players to access different game modes and explore various world sectors. Nauts can be merged and cloned, further expanding the possibilities for players.
